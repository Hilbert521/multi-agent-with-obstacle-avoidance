# multi-agent-with-obstacle-avoidance
 Design a control system on Matlab for robots so that they are able to form a defined shape, then Artificial Potential Field method is applied for robots to avoid obstacles
- In this project, a method of combining second- order formation control with path planning is introduced.
- It uses adjacency matrix to generate the system equation
- Artificial potential field has been used for path planning
- Paper been used are in the file list
